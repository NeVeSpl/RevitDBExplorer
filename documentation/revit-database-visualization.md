## Revit database visualization (RDV)

RDV works for selected element/object in the tree and/or on the list.

Available visualizations:

- model coordinate system displayed at (0,0,0)
- for an `Element`, its bounding box with marked min and max points
- for a `Rebar`, its Normal and marked start and end points
- for an `XYZ`, small coordinate system at that point
- `BoundingBoxXYZ`,
- bounded `Curve`, 
- `Edge`, 
- `Point`, 
- `Soild`, 
- `PlanarFace`
 


**Visualizations are static, they are not automatically updated when element changes.**
